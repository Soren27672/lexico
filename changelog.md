# Changelog

## 1
- Created components PuzzlePage, ShopPage, LeaderboardPage, Blanks, Value and Strikes
- Created basic client-side routes for puzzle, shop and leaderboard pages

## 2
- Added a fetch to the backend within App.js, this uses an environmental variable and the useState hook, activating only on the initial render
    - This is how I will be calling for the first puzzle when a user arrives at the page

## 3
- Added state to hold an unusedIds array, which holds all ids that have not yet been used so that the app is able to generate a different puzzle on successive games
    - This state is initiated with an empty array, but upon the first render, a useEffect fires which replaces the empty array with an array of all puzzle ids
    - This is generated by mapping the fetched array of puzzles by their id values
- App now has a getPuzzle function, this fetches a puzzle object from the backend and then adds it to a client oriented puzzle object that is prepared to hold data about the user's progress in the puzzle
